## Configuration

### Docker

#### Prerequisites

- Docker ([Linux installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
  and [Linux post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/))
- Docker compose (should be included in the Docker installation)

Create a `token.env` file with the following content, replacing the values with your own tokens :

```
DEEZER_TOKEN=abcdefghijklmnoxxxxxxxxxxxx
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
BOT_LANG=fr
```

#### Run

```bash
./update.sh
```

> Or manually : `git pull && docker-compose up -d --build`

### Local usage

- Add `DEEZER_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` as variable environment
- python3.13 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- python3.13 main.py

> You should use a `venv` to avoid conflicts with your system python packages

### Compressed files (zip)

You can send a zip file with multiple tracks inside, the bot will send you a zip file with all the tracks downloaded and
the cover.

In the `token.env` file, add the following line :

```
FORMAT=zip
```

If the `zip` file is too big (more than 50MB), the bot will split the zip file into multiple parts.

### Download URL

You can also make the bot move a file to a specific directory and send you the download link.

In the `token.env` file, add the following line :

```
FORMAT=zip
COPY_FILES_PATH=/path/to/your/directory
FILE_LINK_TEMPLATE=https://yourdomain.com/download/{0}
```

The `{0}` will be replaced by the file name.

I recommend using a reverse proxy to serve the files, like Nginx or Caddy.

If you use `Docker`, you can mount a volume to the container and set the `COPY_FILES_PATH` to `/files`, like this :

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/your/directory:/files
```

### Allow FLAC format

If you have Deezer premium, you can allow the bot to download FLAC files by adding the following line in the `token.env`
file :

```
ENABLE_FLAC=1
```

### Do not send album art

The default behavior is to send album cover and liks to the album and song. If you do not want to send it, set the `SEND_ALBUM_COVER` to `true`.

```
SEND_ALBUM_COVER=true
```

### Troubleshooting

> "Sign in to confirm youâ€™re not a bot. This helps protect our community. Learn more."
> Please note that your account may be banned if you use this feature.

Add a `cookies.txt` in `./local_resources`.
To generate this file, please see : <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp>.

You don't need to restart the bot, it will automatically reload the cookies when downloading a YouTube video.

### Example configuration

```dotenv
# Global configuration
BOT_LANG=en

# Tokens
DEEZER_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCDEFghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345678

# Specific configuration
COPY_FILES_PATH=/files
FILE_LINK_TEMPLATE=https://example.com/dl/{0}
FORMAT=zip
```

### Debugging

> docker logs telegramusic 2>/dev/null | grep "USER_DEBUG"

```bash
grep "USER_DEBUG"                     # All user activities
grep "USER_DEBUG.*user_id=123456789"  # Activities for specific user ID
grep "USER_DEBUG.*username=john"      # Activities for specific username
grep "USER_DEBUG.*Error"              # All user-related errors
```
